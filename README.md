# LS Mail Client is AI powered mail client
Mail client is closed sourced and this repository is used to track issues.

**Project is in early stage, so a lot of features are not implemented yet!**

Whole idea is to create labels of interest like "spam", "bookkeeping", "advertisements", "YourCompany", "Deadline" or similar, and let AI categorize mails by that.
Idea is to later expand this so you can more precisely describe what will go under those labels.
Additional thing is that opening each email pulls out **summary** and **list you the tasks** related to that mail, so you do not spend time readin the mail, but read one sentence summary with tasks listed bellow (see example in image)
